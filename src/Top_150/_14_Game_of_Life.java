    //ðŸ”§ Problem Breakdown:
    //You're given an m x n grid (2D board) with:
    //
    //1 = live cell
    //0 = dead cell
    //Apply the 4 rules to all cells simultaneously to compute the next state.

    //ðŸ”„ Game of Life Rules:
    //Underpopulation: Live cell with <2 live neighbors â†’ dies (1 â†’ 0)
    //Survival: Live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors â†’ lives (1 â†’ 1)
    //Overpopulation: Live cell with >3 live neighbors â†’ dies (1 â†’ 0)
    //Reproduction: Dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors â†’ becomes live (0 â†’ 1)

    //ðŸ§  Smart Trick â€“ Use Encoded States:
    //Instead of using just 0 and 1, we temporarily use:
    //2 â†’ cell was live (1) â†’ will become dead (0)
    //3 â†’ cell was dead (0) â†’ will become live (1)
    //This way, you remember the original state during processing.
