//ðŸ’¬ Problem Summary:
//A happy number eventually becomes 1 after repeatedly replacing it with the sum of squares of its digits.
//If it enters a loop and never reaches 1, it's not happy.

//ðŸ§ª Example 1: n = 19
//1Â² + 9Â² = 1 + 81 = 82
//8Â² + 2Â² = 64 + 4 = 68
//6Â² + 8Â² = 36 + 64 = 100
//1Â² + 0Â² + 0Â² = 1 â†’ Happy! âœ…

//ðŸ”„ Dry Run: n = 19
//Step	n	    Digits	    Squares Sum	    Seen Set
//1	    19	    1, 9	    1+81 = 82	    {19}
//2	    82	    8, 2	    64+4 = 68	    {19, 82}
//3	    68	    6, 8	    36+64 =100	    {19, 82, 68}
//4	    100	    1, 0, 0	    1+0+0 = 1	    {19, 82, 68,100}
//Output: true âœ…

//ðŸ§  Idea:
//We need to detect cycles.
//If we reach 1, it's happy.
//If we see a number again (cycle), it's not happy.
//We can use a HashSet to track seen numbers.
