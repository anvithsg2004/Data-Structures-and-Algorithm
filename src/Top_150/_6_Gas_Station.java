//ðŸš—ðŸ’¨ The Problem in Simple Terms:
//Imagine you're driving a car around a circular route with gas stations.
//At each station i:
//You can fill gas[i] liters of fuel.
//To go from station i to the next one, it costs cost[i] liters.
//You start at some station with empty tank, and you want to go all the way around the circle once.

//ðŸ“¦ You are Given:
//Two arrays:
//gas[i] â†’ how much gas you can fill at station i.
//cost[i] â†’ how much gas you need to drive to the next station.

//You want to start somewhere and go in this order: 0 â†’ 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3 â†’ 4 â†’ back to 0.
//Letâ€™s try starting at station 0:
//Fill 1 gas, need 3 to go to next â†’ NOT enough â†’ FAIL.
//Try station 1:
//Fill 2, need 4 â†’ FAIL.
//Try station 3:
//Fill 4, need 1 â†’ OK.
//At next station fill 5, need 2 â†’ OK.
//Keep goingâ€¦
//ðŸŽ¯ This works! So, answer = 3.

            totalGas = totalGas + gas[i];
            totalCost = totalCost + cost[i];

            tank = tank + gas[i] - cost[i];
            if (tank < 0) {
                start = i + 1;  // Try next station
                tank = 0;       // Reset tank
