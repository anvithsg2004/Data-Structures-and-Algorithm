//Thread pooling is a technique where a fixed number of threads are created in advance and
//reused to execute multiple tasks instead of creating and destroying threads repeatedly.
//This improves performance and reduces the overhead of thread creation.

//Why Use Thread Pooling?
//✔ Avoids Overhead – Creating threads dynamically is expensive. A pool reduces the cost.
//✔ Prevents Excessive Thread Creation – Too many threads can slow down performance and lead to memory issues.
//✔ Manages Concurrency – Limits the number of concurrent tasks, preventing resource exhaustion.
//✔ Enhances Performance – Efficient reuse of threads improves execution speed.
