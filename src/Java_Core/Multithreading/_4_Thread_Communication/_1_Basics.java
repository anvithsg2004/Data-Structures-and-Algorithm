package Java_Core.Multithreading._4_Thread_Communication;

//Thread communication allows multiple threads to talk to each other and
//work together efficiently. This is important when one thread produces data and
//another thread consumes it (like in a producer-consumer problem).

//1️⃣ wait(): Makes the thread pause and release the lock until another thread notifies it.
//2️⃣ notify(): Wakes up a single waiting thread.
//3️⃣ notifyAll(): Wakes up all waiting threads.
