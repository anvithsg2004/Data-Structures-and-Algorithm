package Java_Core.Multithreading._1_Thread._3_Methods;

//Strong Concept
//The reason Thread 3 ran first, even though t1.start() was called before t2.start() and t3.start()
//is because thread execution order is not determined by the order of start() calls.

//When you call:
//t1.start();
//t2.start();
//t3.start();
//This requests the JVM to create and start three separate threads.
//However, the JVM and the Operating System (OS) control thread scheduling, not your program.
//The actual execution order depends on the CPU scheduler, which decides which thread gets CPU time first.

//Key Factors Affecting Thread Execution Order
//1) Thread Scheduling in Java
//2) Thread Priorities
//   Each thread has a priority (default: Thread.NORM_PRIORITY).
//   Higher-priority threads may run first, but itâ€™s not guaranteed.
//3) Race Conditions in Scheduling
//   Multiple threads are started almost simultaneously, and the OS decides which one gets CPU time first.
//   Even if t1.start() is called first, it might be paused while t2 or t3 gets CPU time.

//This method makes the main thread wait until the specified thread finishes execution.
