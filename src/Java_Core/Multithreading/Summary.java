//Summary:

//CompletableFuture is best suited for handling asynchronous computations and chaining tasks
//together with flexible error handling and result combining.


//CountDownLatch is used when you need to wait for multiple threads to finish their tasks
//before proceeding. Itâ€™s ideal for one-time synchronization, and it can't be reused.


//CyclicBarrier is used for synchronizing threads at specific points, and it can be reused.
//It's ideal when you need multiple threads to wait for each other before proceeding in a
//repetitive manner.
