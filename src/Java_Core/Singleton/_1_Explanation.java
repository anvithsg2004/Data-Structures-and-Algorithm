//        Singleton Design Pattern (in simple terms):
//        The Singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance (or object) in the entire application and provides a global point of access to that instance.
//
//        Key Features:
//        1) One instance only: It makes sure only one object of the class is created.
//        2) Global access: You can access this single object globally from anywhere in the program.
//
//        Where Singleton is Used:
//        Singleton is often used in scenarios where you need one and only one object for managing certain resources. Some examples include:
//
//        1) Database connections: Only one connection pool is needed for efficiency.
//        2) Logging: A single logger instance used throughout the application.
//        3) Configuration settings: To ensure consistency across the application.

//        How It Works:
//        1) Private constructor: Ensures that no other class can create a new instance.
//        2) Static instance: Only one instance is created when the class is loaded.
//        3) Global access: The getInstance() method gives access to that one instance.
//
//        Why Use Singleton?
//        1) It controls resource access (like databases).
//        2) Ensures consistent behavior across the application by using the same instance.
