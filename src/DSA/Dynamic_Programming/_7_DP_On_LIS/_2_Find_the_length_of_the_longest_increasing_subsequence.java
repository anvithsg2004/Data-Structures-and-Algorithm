//This is a Tabulation algorithm to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

//Final Conclusion
//Use dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], new_value); when:
//âœ” You only need the best possible value for dp[i].
//âœ” You donâ€™t need to track previous indices or counts.
//
//Use if (condition) { dp[i] = new_value; } when:
//âœ” You need to inherit values (like count or index tracking).
//âœ” You need to ensure updates happen only under strict conditions
//(e.g., for maintaining paths in LIS).
//ðŸ‘‰ If unsure, using Math.max is safer for most cases!
