//Count Primes
//The technique which I use for calculation of the primes, that is called as Sieve of Eratosthenes.
// It is a fast way to find all prime numbers up to n.

//Create a boolean array isPrime[] of size (n+1), initialized to true.
//isPrime[i] = true means 'i' is prime.
//Start from 2 (first prime) and mark all its multiples as false (not prime).
//Example: Mark 4, 6, 8, 10, ... as false.
//Move to the next number that is still true (prime) and repeat marking its multiples.
//Continue this process until âˆšn, because any non-prime beyond this would have been marked earlier.
//The numbers that remain true are prime numbers.
