package DSA.Heaps;

//Important Points →
//1) It is a complete binary tree (All levels are filled except last levels).
//2) Every Node Value >= All of its children.
//3) Take an index and divide the index with 2 and get the absolute value of it.
// That is the parent index of it.

//Two types of Heaps →
//1) Min Heap
//Smallest element at the root; parent ≤ children.
//[1, 3, 8, 5, 9] = Array Representation
//        1       = Binary Tree Representation
//       / \
//      3   8
//     / \
//    5   9
//2) Max Heap
//Largest element at the root; parent ≥ children.
//[9, 5, 8, 1, 3] = Array Representation
//        9       = Binary Tree Representation
//       / \
//      5   8
//     / \
//    1   3
